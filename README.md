# Command-Line-Readme-Generator
The Commnad-Line-Readme-Generator is an application for creating consistent high quality professional README.ms files easily using the Command Line Interface(CLI). In this application, the CLI is making use of node.js to take user input to write to a file, particularly creating a readme file and populating its content based on the user's input. 

The app has been developed using node.js and node modules such as fs, path, util, inquirer. NOde.js was installed in the computer and the started files from bootcamp spot has been used to get started on creating the app. Javascript code has been written and modularisation has been used to export functions between the javascript files within the repo.
